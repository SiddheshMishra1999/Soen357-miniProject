            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>When Covid began and quarantine was enforced, many people switched to ordering food online,
                this was a great time for local restaurants. But now that covid has ended people are
                slowly but surely going back to their old habits of ordering takeout from big restaurants. 
                This is a big problem for local restaurants as they are not doing as well as they used to and 
                this could be very bad for buisiness on the long run.
