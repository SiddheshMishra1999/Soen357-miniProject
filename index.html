            <p class="intro-p">
                Most people in society enjoy an occasional date night, or break from cooking at home.
                Some people eat out on a more frequent basis but what if we told you that most people eat at
                franchise restaurants or restaurants that are owned by big corporations
                and you are missing out on some great Local Restaurants in your area.
                This app will help introduce you to some amazing local food restaurants
                that meet all of your craving needs.

        <div class="the-problem" id="the-problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>After a gruesome shutdown period, local restaurants are finally opening again.
                This means, they now need a way to attract customers in order to stay in business.
                Due to the pandemic, people had to order food and the first places they would think
                of are big fast food chains or well known restaurants. How does one compete with that?
                How does an unknown local restaurant compete with these big fast food chains?
                This economy is ruthless towards local eateries, who should they turn to in these tough
                times? There are very few applications available that help promote local restaurants.
                A dedicated place where users can find a place to eat that fits their taste and has what
                they are looking for, all the while supporting a local business.

        <!-- <div class="solution">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                Our solution to this problem is a dedicated application with only local restaurants as an option.
                The user experience is also very important for us, this is why we want to make our application
                as simple as it can be so users of any age group should be able to use it without having to break
                their heads. We intend to have optional authentication for the users who want to save their
                search history so they can find the restaurants they have previously visited with just 1 press
                of a button. Of course users who do not wish to authenticate can also use the application. T
                he authentication is also there for a new business owner who wishes to add his or her business
                to the application. They can authenticate as an owner and send a request that will be reviewed
                by a team and added to the application. The application will have a search for restaurants with
                different filter options such as: Cuisine, wait time,rating, pick up, dine-in, location. With these
                filters, the user will get a selection of restaurants they can choose from.

            <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
            <div class="research">
                <h2>The Research</h2>
                <p>
                    Local restaurants have existed for a very long time, but when you ask someone if they know
                    of any local restaurant, the person will most likely say no or name a restaurant like Boustan
                    which is a chain restaurant. The purpose of this research is to find a way to help local
                    restaurants get more customers and increase their profits to minimize the detrimental effects
                    of high inflation. In order to do this, we must start by looking at the different applications
                    available at the moment to the people and analyze their positives and negatives points.
                    It is also very important to understand people's mentality and see what makes a person want
                    to eat at a franchise restaurant over a local restaurant. What better way to do so then by
                    sending out a survey to the people and asking them ourselves.
                    <br>
                    In addition to this, it was reported a while back by Restaurants Canada that many restaurant owners have 
                    had to watch their business fall apart as it was negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Many local restaurant owners 
                    were thereby forced to close down eventually as their sales dropped drastically. With high inflations constantly making consumers rethink their 
                    decision to dine-out, many local restaurant businesses see almost no light with regards to recovering themselves from this situation, 
                    and so we should develop a product that would help not just the consumers, but also the local restaurant owners as well.
                    <br>
                    Before all this, let's define a few terms so there is no confusion!
                    What is a local restaurant?
                    During an interview with Damian Saktura,
                    I asked him what he considered as a local restaurant,
                    the answer surprised us! He said: “A restaurant that
                    is within walking distance from me”. That is when we realized, it's a confusion
                    many people may have so here is our definition of a local restaurant:
                    A restaurant that is owned by a person or family and managed by them.
                    We will be using this definition about local restaurants from here on.


                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="current-market" id="current-market">
                <h2>What is currently available?</h2>
                <p>There are many different applications available on the market that 
                    allow users to browse restaurants and choose where to eat or order food from. 
                    Some of the popular existing apps are Zagat, Foursquare, Eat24, Ubereats, 
                    Skip the Dishes and many others. These are great apps for an everyday user who 
                    is just looking for a restaurant to eat at. These apps have features like delivery services, 
                    some will tell you the wait time, they also give you options to pick-up directly at the restaurant.
                    These restaurant apps however have some faults such as not having any way to filter and find local 
                    restaurants specifically. All these apps promote mostly the big franchise restaurants but they 
                    neglect having a dedicated section to encourage local restaurants only.
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, almost no applications allow local restaurant owners to promote their restaurant themselves. Often, consumers google 
                    for "good restaurants near me" and the odds of local restaurants making the top 5 first searches are very rare and this given is if they are just as 
                    good as the big franchise restaurants.

                <p>In order to have a good understanding of the different types of potential users,

                         This will help us to incorporate the most popular needs in our application ensuring a sustainable formula to 
                         keep the restaurant's client base.

                        choose a local restaurant over a franchise restaurant so we know what pressure points 
                        to include in our ads and our application design elements.

                        Question 7:<br>
                        This question was a pure marketing question wanting our participants indirect opinion on the main color for our application.
                        Essentially it is our decision however we think it is a smart way to involve our client base and tapping into their 
                        subconscious on what color they associate with food most. This will most likely attract them to use our platform to 
                        choose their next restaurant outing.

                        We can see that the most popular answer was the color Orange which aligns with our initial 
                        design colors so this has validated that orange would be part of our color palette.

                        Question 8:<br>
                        Asking this question was to collect data for our selection of filters to motivate our users 
                        to try new restaurants putting our local restaurant into the spotlight.

                        Question 9:<br>
                        Now in this question we specifically ask them the filters they would like to have on our website. 
                        With this we will condense the amount of filters by keeping the most popular ones so that our application 
                        is not too overwhelming with choices.

                    We have chosen two types of personas one being a client and one being 
                    a restaurant owner to explore all user types for our application. 
                    Our first persona is Selena Marcil is a university student who enjoys eating out. 
                    She enjoys trying different restaurants and cultured food but finds it hard to find 
                    quality restaurants nearby. Our second persona is Damien Abbot, he is a local restaurant 
                    owner that is trying to gain more visibility. He is constantly looking for ways to increase 
                    his clientele and attract more customers to come eat at his restaurant. 
                    These two personas were analyzed to help us provide the best service to our users 
                    when using our application taking into consideration their needs.

                Using the results obtained from the survey along with the user personas, 
                we were able to define the potential challenges and limitations a user can encounter

                Using the surveys, we were able to determine the appropriate type of users

                the goals that were set for this application.

                The goals we were able to identify is, satisfying the users food craving 
                by prompting them with the correct filters to help guide them to the perfect local 
                restaurant pertaining to their current need. The user would like for it to be easy

                    we appealed to one of our user personas, Selena Marsil,

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution to this problem is a dedicated application with only local restaurants as an option.
                    The user experience is also very important for us, this is why we want to make our application
                    as simple as it can be so users of any age group should be able to use it without having to break
                    their heads(i.e., make the application accessible and inclusive for the widest possible
                    number of users). We also intend to provide an optional authentication functionality for the users who want to save their
                    search history so they can find the restaurants they have previously visited with just 1 press
                    of a button. Of course users who do not wish to authenticate can also use the application. The 
                    authentication is also there for new business owners who seek to add their business
                    to the application in order to promote themselves. They can authenticate as an owner and send a request that will be reviewed
                    by a team and added to the application. The local restaurant owners can provide the name of their restaurant, promote the dishes they 
                    think would favor their promotion, and even provide pictures of their restaurant and menu items. The application will have a search for restaurants with
                    different filter options such as: Cuisine, wait time, rating, pick up, dine-in, location. With these
                    filters, the users will get a selection of restaurants they can choose from. A great solution with this design, is that a restaurant owner can also 
                    use the application as a hungry user!

                    <p>
                        The sketches for this application illustrate the initial idea we had in mind.                        In our sketches we decided early on in our design that we opted for a platform 
                        that did not need a user to sign in, the application can be used without having 
                        to sign in and putting in personal information. The user however does have some 
                        functionalities that can only be used if they do sign in as a “hungry user” such 
                        as favoriting certain restaurants or rating the restaurant after their experience. 
                        We did create a sign in/ create an account for the restaurant owners to add their 
                        restaurants to the application platform if they wish to be a part of the Feed me 
                        Local community and gain visibility on our application.

                        better represent
                        the layout of our application and to provide the user an application that guarantees a positive
                        user experience and interaction.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Color Palette</h2>
                    <p>Here is our initial color palette, we initially decided to go with dark green as an 
                        inspiration from Uber as well as adding a light blue intended for the text, 
                        however soon realized that this was not strategic. The initial color palette 
                        was not user friendly nor did it link well with the purpose of our application. 
                        In that case, we decided to change it to the most popular color associated to 
                        food according to our survey.

                    <p> We soon realized that those colors would not work properly so here is the fianl color palette

                    <p>Keeping one color that pops, helps the user to focus on what is essential in the application 
                        and is less distracting. Black and white are common colors, formally known as placeholder 
                        neutral colors and are used to enhance the visibility of cartoon images as well as writing, 
                        to contrast against the orange background.

                    </div>
                    <p>We have chosen these fonts since they are the most neutral and 
                        aesthetic fonts that fit with the design of our application. 
                        It is not too bold and intense, and they are not too thin that 
                        someone would have a trouble reading, they are the perfect inbetween. 
                        The fonts are simple to make sure the emphasis is on the restaurants and 
                        their images to attract the user to their restaurant. 
                        The fonts also give a more inviting/ welcoming feeling, linking it more to 
                        the theme of encouraging people to go to local restaurants.

                    <h2>Name and Logo</h2>
                    <p>The name of our application is “Feed me Local”,
                        as it directly conveys the purposes this application intends on fulfilling,
                        which is to provide a dedicated place where users can find a place to eat that
                        fits their taste and has what they are looking for, all the while supporting a
                        local business. Moreover, the name of the application is quite easy to remember,
                        as it appeals to the two major words used by humans in most of their lives “Feed” and “Me”,
                        and so naming the application using these two words will overtime create a mental connection
                        the user can associate with. Furthermore, we used a little slogan under the word “Local”,
                        which is “to satisfy our food cravings”, and this is because we often find ourselves craving
                        for things to eat at random times when we are home. Hence, the user will be more encouraged
                        to search for local restaurants, through our application, whenever they feel a craving.
                        <br>
                        We designed a simple logo that uses the Orange, white, black and dark beige 
                        color palettes.The words “Feed Me” and “Local” are separated by an outline of a rooftop, 
                        and this is to emphasize on the idea of feeling making them feeling comfortable by appealing 
                        to the idea of home, along with their desire to find food to address their hunger, 
                        through the words “Feed Me”.

                    <p>
                        Once we had finalized the color palette and the font styles, we were ready to make our mock up on Figma. 
                        We wanted to create an inviting feeling for the user once they open the app. 
                        The logo splash screen is meant to make them smile and put them in a mood to try something new. 
                        We wanted our mockup to simulate what our application would look like to the user. 
                        By seeing the mockup we can ensure the flow of our application is logical and organized in a way 
                        that does not overwhelm the user. So with the mockup we were able to move some features around 
                        and to make the experience of using our application more logical and pleasurable.

                        This is where we use the mock up that we made and make them interactive 
                        to simulate user interaction. Clickable buttons allow the user to see what different
                        buttons on the app will do. For example, if a user clicks on "Join the local community",
                        they will be brought to the registration page where they have the option to login or create a new
                        account.
                        <br>
                        Small interaction like this is what makes a prototype interesting and what will later help the developers make
                        replica based on it. 
                        In our prototype, the user is able to go through many different process which allows different types of users to see
                        what the others can see. Let's say you are a restaurant owner, well you get to see what a regular user is able to see,
                        as well as what someone who decided now to login can see.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Creating the “Feed Me Local” application allowed us 
                    to gain more knowledge and a better understanding of the UX and UI design processes. 
                    We learned that the design of an application should directly make reference to a target users'
                     needs and that their needs is what will allow us to define and distinguish the more important 
                     features over the less important ones</p>
