                Most people in society enjoy an occasional date night, or break from cooking at home.
                Some people eat out on a more frequent basis but what if we told you that most people eat at
                franchise restaurants or restaurants that are owned by big corporations
                and you are missing out on some great Local Restaurants in your area.
                This app will help introduce you to some amazing local food restaurants
                that meet all of your craving needs.

        <div class="the-problem" id="the-problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>After a gruesome shutdown period, local restaurants are finally opening again.
                This means, they now need a way to attract customers in order to stay in business.
                Due to the pandemic, people had to order food and the first places they would think
                of are big fast food chains or well known restaurants. How does one compete with that?
                How does an unknown local restaurant compete with these big fast food chains?
                This economy is ruthless towards local eateries, who should they turn to in these tough
                times? There are very few applications available that help promote local restaurants.
                A dedicated place where users can find a place to eat that fits their taste and has what
                they are looking for, all the while supporting a local business.

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                Our solution to this problem is a dedicated application with only local restaurants as an option.
                The user experience is also very important for us, this is why we want to make our application
                as simple as it can be so users of any age group should be able to use it without having to break
                their heads. We intend to have optional authentication for the users who want to save their
                search history so they can find the restaurants they have previously visited with just 1 press
                of a button. Of course users who do not wish to authenticate can also use the application. T
                he authentication is also there for a new business owner who wishes to add his or her business
                to the application. They can authenticate as an owner and send a request that will be reviewed
                by a team and added to the application. The application will have a search for restaurants with
                different filter options such as: Cuisine, wait time,rating, pick up, dine-in, location. With these
                filters, the user will get a selection of restaurants they can choose from.

            <div class="research">
                <h2>The Research</h2>
                <p>
                    Local restaurants have existed for a very long time, but when you ask someone if they know
                    of any local restaurant, the person will most likely say no or name a restaurant like Boustan
                    which is a chain restaurant. The purpose of this research is to find a way to help local
                    restaurants get more customers and increase their profits to minimize the detrimental effects
                    of high inflation. In order to do this, we must start by looking at the different applications
                    available at the moment to the people and analyze their positives and negatives points.
                    It is also very important to understand people's mentality and see what makes a person want
                    to eat at a franchise restaurant over a local restaurant. What better way to do so then by
                    sending out a survey to the people and asking them ourselves.
                    Before all this, let's define a few terms so there is no confusion!
                    What is a local restaurant?
                    During an interview with Damian Saktura,
                    I asked him what he considered as a local restaurant,
                    the answer surprised us! He said: “A restaurant that
                    is within walking distance from me”. That is when we realized, it's a confusion
                    many people may have so here is our definition of a local restaurant:
                    A restaurant that is owned by a person or family and managed by them.
                    We will be using this definition about local restaurants from here on.

                    Here are the diagrams of the response we got:

                    <p>The name of our application is “Feed me Local”,
                        as it directly conveys the purposes this application intends on fulfilling,
                        which is to provide a dedicated place where users can find a place to eat that
                        fits their taste and has what they are looking for, all the while supporting a
                        local business. Moreover, the name of the application is quite easy to remember,
                        as it appeals to the two major words used by humans in most of their lives “Feed” and “Me”,
                        and so naming the application using these two words will overtime create a mental connection
                        the user can associate with. Furthermore, we used a little slogan under the word “Local”,
                        which is “to satisfy our food cravings”, and this is because we often find ourselves craving
                        for things to eat at random times when we are home. Hence, the user will be more encouraged
                        to search for local restaurants, through our application, whenever they feel a craving.
